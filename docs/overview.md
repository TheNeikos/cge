# Card Game Engine

The Card Game Engine is a versatile engine meant to be used to build
multiplayer card games with it.

It is not a standalone server but meant to be used as a library in executables.

It is meant to be self-contained, with the primary communication happening
through messages being exchanged with the engine.

See the [game architecture](./game_architecture.md) document on how you would
implement a game using CGE.
